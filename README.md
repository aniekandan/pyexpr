# PyExpr: A Python Expression Evaluator
PyExpr is a simple expression evaluator written in Python. It provides a simple command-line interface to evaluate arithmetic expressions with support for basic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and parentheses.

## Installation
To use PyExpr, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git
```

No additional libraries or packages are required, as PyExpr is written entirely in Python using built-in modules.

## Usage
To use PyExpr, simply run the main.py script in a Python environment. You can enter arithmetic expressions using the supported operators and parentheses, and PyExpr will evaluate them and print the result.

For example:

```
$ python main.py
PyExpr -- Enter expressions to evaluate. Press CTRL + C to quit.
calc> 2.0 + 2.2
4.2
calc> 3 * (4 + 5)
27.0
```
